# EINSTEIN RINGS: GRAVITATIONAL LENSING

Some objects are simple but are very useful for example take lenses, magnifying glass is lens, the specs we use are lens, the microscopes biologists use are lenses. If you casually see lens, it just distorts the view of objects behind this. In this article, we are going to understand about a lens which is helping us find galaxies and stars which are rather unseen. This lens is formed by the one of nature’s fundamental forces, Gravity. This phenomenon is called gravitational lensing.
                             Albert Einstein in 1915, published paper of his work on general relativity and it’s one of most important consequence is that heavy objects distort the geometry of space-time fabric around them. This makes the objects around to travel in curved paths. Light which travels in straight line in vacuum, also experiences curvature in presence of massive objects. Due to this, a distant star would appear in a different position from its actual position. This was one of the predictions of theory of general relativity. This was experimentally verified by Arthur Eddington in 1919 by observing the position of stars during solar eclipse and during the night. Same stars appeared in different position when sun was present and not present during the night. This happened because sun was bending light from these stars.

The objects need to have extremely large mass to be able to bend the light. Stars, galaxies, and cluster of galaxies fit in this category very well. As these objects bend light coming from distant stars or pulsars, we end up seeing very interesting images. We might see multiple images of same object or distorted image of the object. Unlike optical lenses, gravitational

different amount due to which we get to see multiple images of same object. If an object is travelling behind a gravitational lens, we see a distorted image of the object. 

            If gravitational lens is somewhat symmetric and lies on the line which connects observer and the source, we get to see a distorted image which is a complete circle. These beautiful rings are called “Einstein Rings”.  If the lens is not uniform or is extended (for example, cluster of galaxies) we would not see a complete circle but see an arc. 

            This phenomenon is not only beautiful but also has many applications. This helps in determining the masses of galaxies and other large bodies by calculating the deflection they caused to light. This also helps us to map the actual positions of different bodies because when we observe the sky, we see billions of billions of galaxies and stars however, many of

them are multiple or distorted images of same object. Another application of gravitational lensing is microlensing. When an exoplanet which do not emit light passes by a galaxy, if this planet has huge mass, the light from the galaxy is distorted making it brighter. This can be used to detect exoplanets.

Another application of gravitational lensing is detecting dark matter. Dark matter is something which has mass but does not emit or interact with light. Which makes it impossible for us to detect it with telescopes. We can use gravitational lensing to detect it by looking at the amount of deflection it caused to light.

This beautiful phenomenon occurs very rarely, and this remains a mystery that why does this occur very rarely. Einstein rings and gravitational lensing illustrate the interplay between gravity, light and cosmic geometry while also giving us many insights on dark matter, relativistic physics, and expansion of universe. As we end this article here, these gravitational mirages will continue to illuminate darkest corners of the astrophysics, bridging the seen and unseen universe.
