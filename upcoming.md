Greetings from Horizon - the Physics and Astronomy club of IIT Madras!


Ever wondered what lies beyond our solar system?

Or what does gravitational lensing mean?  


Maybe you've been curious about that lauded theory, special relativity? Or about how landing on a planet in a different galaxy feels like?



Question no longer, because Horizon IITM brings to you Horizon's Guide to the Galaxy where we will introduce various topics in physics and astronomy (and also answer the above questions 😉). The schedule of the events is provided below.


|Date | Title|
|---|---|
|06 Feb. '23 | Expedition to Exoplanets |
|07 Feb. '23 | Today's Special: Relativity |
|08 Feb. '23 | An Expanding Universe |
|09 Feb. '23 | _Boltzmann Session: Simulating Stellar-clusters_ |
|10 Feb. '23 | Observational Astronomy |

After some exciting activities for this year, we will introduce Boltzmann sessions to the freshie batch with its first instalment in this week of fun-filled things! Started as an informal meeting where students would gather together to talk about a topic or their research project, the Boltzmann session will help you interact with cool seniors and learn at the same time. 


So allow us to be your Babel Fish and let's Hitch-hike our Heart of Gold, shoot through a wormhole and cross the horizons to explore distant galaxies and restaurants at the end of the universe :D
